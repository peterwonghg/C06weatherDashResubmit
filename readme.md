## Your Task

Use the OpenWeather API to create a Weather Dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS that will help a traveller to see the weather outlook for multiple cities to enable trip planning.

Displays both the current weather condition and 5 days forecast condition

### Current Weather Condition
```

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
```

```

## clearSearchHistory function
This function enable the historical searches to be cleared when the "Clear History" button is clicked perhaps used when a different trip is planned

## Future Improvement
I need to stop being carried away and commit more often to enable me to optimise Github functionality
